### Breadcrumb Background Image&#x20;

You can upload a background image for the Breadcrumb.&#x20;

1. Click on the Breadcrumb 2
2. Set Section Settings > Background Type to Image&#x20;
3. And upload your background image. We recommend that you use a background image with a slightly blurred layer on top, this will help the text of the breadcrumb stand out
