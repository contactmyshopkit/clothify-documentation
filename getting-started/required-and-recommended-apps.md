In this article, we will provide recommendations on essential and recommended apps. Please note that these apps are not included in the theme package and must be downloaded from the Shopify App store. We have thoroughly tested and utilized these apps before recommending them to you. More importantly, they are all free and created by Shopify experts. If you encounter any issues while using these apps, please reach out to the app's support team for assistance.

### 1. Apps for multi-languages & multi-currencies

* [Shopify Translate & Adapt](https://apps.shopify.com/translate-and-adapt)

These two apps are automatically downloaded when you add a new language & a new market. Let's check if they are in your Apps & Sales channels. If they're not there, you need to download them manually.\
